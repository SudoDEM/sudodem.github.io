SudoDEM is specifically designed for modeling non-spherical particles using discrete element method (DEM), which inherits a basic framework of an open-source DEM code, YADE. The project aims to develop a robust 2/3D DEM code for convex particles, e.g., polyhedrons, super-ellipsoids, poly-superellipsoids, cylinders and cones. The concave shapes can be constructed by grouping the convex ones with the typical "clump" technique.
