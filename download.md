Please check this website or follow the [Project on Researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/project/SudoDEM-a-discrete-element-code-for-non-spherical-particles) for the updates if needed.

The source code of SudoDEM2D/3D is hosted at a GitHub repository [SudoDEM](https://github.com/SudoDEM/SudoDEM).
- main program (with third-party libraries included)
  - [Latest sources and binaries](https://github.com/SudoDEM/SudoDEM/releases/tag/v1.3.6)
  - [Older released versions](https://github.com/SudoDEM/SudoDEM/releases)

- third-party libraries:
   - sources: to do later (You can find them on their official pages).
   - binaries for 3D only:
     - [3rdlibs.tar.xz](https://zenodo.org/record/2683766#.XNQh7-EzY5k)[md5sum: 6f6bf4686d0a752dffba0259d9b50c07]

Note: Binaries were compiled just for Ubuntu 14 ~ 18. For other Linux distributions, you have to comiple and install from the sources. The compilation and installation withour root will be introduced in the quick guide listed below.
