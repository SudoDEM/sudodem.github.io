# Features
> SudoDEM = sudo + DEM: a powerful ‘pseudo’ DEM simulator

## Basic Features
Forked off YADE in 2014 with basic features:
- C++ and Python 3
- OpenMP acceleration
- Linux platform

## More
You may concern:
- _Learning curve_ — easy to get started
- _Documents_ — YADE community and our quick guide
- _Both 2D & 3D_ — Sure
- _Non-spherical particles_ — the focus of SudoDEM
- _Shape customization_ — the general interface of contact detection algorithms
- _Efficiency_ — :)

## Others
- _The Hertz-Mindlin Model_: for super-ellipsoids only
- _The Rolling Resistance Model_: for both spheres and non-spheres
- _Flexible Membrane_: constructed by using the finite element (FE)
- _Easy Compilation and Installation_: less dependencies, which help to compile and install SudoDEM on a PC or server without the root permission.
- _Damping_: local and viscous damping

## On the list:
- MPI & GPU acceleration 
- Escaping from Boost (on-going)
